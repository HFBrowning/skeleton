A readme to describe the contents of 'tests'
Hilary Browning

This folder contains a loose collection of files that are intended the test the script and output in various ways:

- Any python scripts (test_util.py, __init__.py) correspond to unit testing of functions for PROJ_NAME. Unit testing scripts are named based upon what module they test; for example, test_util.py provides some testing of util.py. Other unit tests made in the future should follow the same naming convention.
